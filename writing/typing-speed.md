One time after a friendly game of [TypeRacer](https://play.typeracer.com),
a coworker asked me whether I thought typing speed mattered for work. I answered
conservatively, "there's absolutely a minimum and faster generally
means you can try more things per unit time, but the gains probably
drop off pretty rapidly". It's been years since that exchange, but I
was reminded of it recently, and, rather painfully.

Ten days ago, I retired my Kinesis Freestyle2 Blue and bought an
Ergodox EZ. The price difference is rather steep, but I figured this
thing will last me forever, unlike the cheaper keyboards I usually
churn through once every 1&ndash;3 years. I also got it at a discount
by buying pre-owned but "brand new" (and it does seem to be pretty
much brand new).

I'm skeptical of ortholinear layouts. People say it's better because
of the way we extend our fingers or whatever, but I suspect people
mainly like it because it's more &aelig;sthetically pleasing and packs
better. But let me tell you, the adjusment from staggered to
ortholinear is <em>significant</em>.
And in the holy-crap-do-I-even-know-how-to-type way.

The layout that I'm using is very close to a regular QWERTY keyboard,
and I'm already accustomed to a split keyboard. On my Freestyle2, I
regularly clock 120 WPM or more on TypeRacer. Day 1 of using the
Ergodox, I was crawling at 50 WPM (RIP avg WPM...). I was prepared for
a drop-off going in, but I'm still shocked. I can only imagine what
it'd be like for someone coming from non-split keyboards.

I went all in on using the keyboard 100% of the time, for work and for
personal use, and I can confidently say this: typing speed absolutely
matters for a software engineer. Before I offend anyone, I'd like to
clarify that I don't mean to say that you can't be a good software
engineer if you're not typing at 300 WPM. What I mean by &quot;it
matters&quot; is that the 100 WPM version of you is much more
effective than the 50 WPM version of you.

Besides writing code, a lot of my work involves Slack messages and
writing documentary material. On the surface, when writing documents,
typing speed is rarely the limiting factor.

<h3>Documentation</h3>

Here's some back-of-the-envelope math. Say I'm writing a 500 word
document. I'll probably spend anywhere between 15 to 30 minutes on
this, depending on how much I'm going to research and how much I'm
going to rework the doc. That works out to be 17&ndash;33 WPM, well
within reach for even non-touch typists.

What I've omitted though are all the words that were typed, deleted,
retyped, and so on. I rework a lot because I almost always need to see
all the darned words on the screen before I can assess whether it's
any good. And I want it to be good (clear, helpful, descriptive) because
a lot of coworkers are going to read this. And it usually isn't very
good on the first try. And maybe I have a terrible writing process. In
any case, I can easily retype things four or more times. Now we're
looking at 68&ndash;132 WPM if I want to fit it in the 15 to 30 minutes!

<h3>Issue Tracking</h3>

That was for documents. Little documentary messages like comments in
an issue tracker or descriptions of work items are usually shorter
both in time and in words. Generally though, the more descriptive, the
more helpful for future readers and the fewer meetings need to be had.
When I switched to the new keyboard, I noticed I was starting to dread
being more descriptive because it would take too much time. I'm not
quite sure whether this experience applies to others, but if nothing
else, typing faster saves time here.

<h3>Slack</h3>

Let's talk about Slack messages. This was what hurt me the most on day
1 of the new keyboard. A lot of work happens on Slack. The messages
are conversational and full (as to not appear too brusque) and, often,
the exchanges on Slack are rapid back and forth and too short for a
meeting. According to [Virtual Speech](https://virtualspeech.com/blog/average-speaking-rate-words-per-minute),
people converse in English anywhere between 120&ndash;150 WPM. Unlike
documents where my nominal content production rate is low &mdash;
lower than many white collar workers' typing speeds &mdash;
conversations happen faster than most people's typing speed. Not only
was it frustrating to slow down some conversations, but I found once
again I was starting to avoid entering into Slack conversations.

One could argue that the conversations probably weren't important
enough to have or that the details in the issue tracker weren't
important enough to include. But written communication can easily be
misconstrued and I strongly believe that effective communication with
all the little details is important for an effective team.

<h3>Coding</h3>

Communication is important, but something else shook me to my core.
Just like how I was starting to avoid Slack conversations, I was also
starting to avoid reworking code. Not only was I writing code very
slowly (and this is not, in general, a bad thing), I was leaving it in
a subpar state.

There's no substitute for planning and being thoughtful. Before
coding, I certainly think about what needs to be accomplished, how the
code will look, how it's going to be structured. The big pieces are
there, but there's usually more than one way to do it. Trying those
different ways out has given me the best results. But with the new
keyboard, I was typing much more slowly and using shortcuts more
slowly. It became costlier in terms of time to try different
approaches. And when trying something out costs very little, we're
more likely to try them. We feel better about throwing it out for
something better. We're less likely to invest more subpar ideas (&aacute;
la sunk cost fallacy).

Really, this whole thing is about being fast. When the primary
interface to the computer is a keyboard, typing fast is a core part to
being fast. So yes, typing speed matters, so don't overlook training
to type faster.

Over a week has passed, and after training daily &mdash; the Oryx
trainer for the Ergodox is decent and has a heatmap feature to inform
layout reconfiguration &mdash; I'm back to 100 WPM and still working
towards 120. Was it worth the switch for those sweet, sweet key
switches? We'll have to see.
