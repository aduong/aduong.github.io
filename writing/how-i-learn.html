    <h1>How I Learn</h1>
    <time>2020-08-07</time>
    <p>This week, I was invited to do a little Q&A with <a href="https://summerofshipping.com/">Summer of Shipping</a> (SoS). One of the questions that Phil asked me was along the lines of "what do you do when you encounter a topic or problem that you know nothing about?" I answered it as eloquently as I could in the Discord voice channel. That is to say, probably not very &mdash; I'm the rehearse-what-I'm-going-to-say-to-customer-support-on-the-phone kind of guy. So, to do the question some justice, I'm going to try again, but in writing.</p>
    <!-- I learned this kind of separator is called a dinkus and now I'm just using them all over the place, even if I probably shouldn't. It's okay, the novelty will wear off. -->
    <hr class="dinkus" />
    <p>Not knowing much about something. This happens to me all the time and not just for work. Cooking all sorts of food, what to do with money, and taking care of plants are some examples in the past, present, and future. A career in software puts me in this situation a lot too. <em>Especially</em>, frontend web development which has changed &mdash; and is still changing &mdash; drastically over the past decades. But anyway, I think there are some common, important ideas that work for me that speed up the learning process:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Find good learning resources</li>
      <li>Identify and focus on principles</li>
      <li>There is no magic</li>
      <li>You have time to learn</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Finding Good Learning Resources</h2>
    <p>There's a lot of stuff out there on the Internet. Most of it is ads, listicles, cat videos, or people trying to sell you stuff (more ads). Of the information that's out there, a lot of it is poorly presented, poorly written, insufficient, or straight up untrue <small class="parenthetical">(maybe like my writing, on all counts)</small>. Bad resources waste your time, demoralize you, and drain your confidence. Think bad lectures, textbooks, presentations, documentation. Good resources are useful and can be enjoyable. Think Khan Academy videos, your favourite podcasts, the Stripe API documentation. You want to learn from good resources and avoid bad ones.</p>
    <p>So how do you tell the difference between good resources and bad ones? It can be highly subjective. You probably didn't agree with all my examples above. People learn differently and respond differently to different learning materials. The important things are that you recognize that there are differences and to be selective. I have some heuristics that help me which might be worth a try.</p>
    <p>One heuristic: ask around for recommendations. At work, I have the privilege of working with diligent teammates who come from diverse backgrounds and specialize, in one way or another, in different areas and technologies. In many areas, they know of good learning resources which work for them and <em>might</em> work for me. Non-work peers can also offer up valuable recommendations. People will readily rave about first-rate resources.</p>
    <p>Another heuristic: I find that significant pieces of work such as online courses and books also tend to be very good resources for going deeper on a topic. Unfortunately, this is not always the case for software topics. A lot of books in software don't age well. Watch out for books on specific frameworks which can obsolesce so quickly that they're almost useless at time of publication <small class="parenthetical">(the book <em>and</em> the framework)</small>. <!-- Ahem, Akka in Action --> Do the research: sample it, check the reviews. Don't worry if books (or other media) don't do it for you though; I know many very competent peers who don't have the time or aren't as jazzed by books.</p>
    <p>For software specifically, documentation can be very good for learning. This is related to the idea of focusing on principles. Well-written documentation will often lead you to other useful resources. We like to make connections in our minds and in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext">hypertext</a>. I have more to say about documentation, but I'll leave that for the next section.</p>
    <p>I find my heuristics above work pretty well for me and they might be good starting points for someone else. Again, the important things are to recognize qualitative differences in resources, seek the good resources, and avoid the bad ones.</p>
    <h2>Identify and Focus on Principles</h2>
    <p>Many complex systems and topics emerge from simple but profound sets of principles, ideas, or rules. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory#Applications">Set theory</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus">&lambda;-calculus</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_action">principle of least action</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_of_thermodynamics">laws of thermodynamics</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_and_demand">supply and demand</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attachment_theory">attachment theory</a>, the principle of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glengarry_Glen_Ross_(film)">always be closing</a>, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34536488-principles">Ray Dalio's Principles</a>, and so on <small class="parenthetical">(to name a few that I'm absolutely not qualified to talk about)</small>. Figuring these out and focusing on them makes learning easier, faster, and the knowledge that you learn more versatile.</p>
    <p>How does this work? What's an extremely poignant example?</p>
    <p>Well-written documentation will express the themes, design decisions, and ideas that underlie the software that it's describing. It will also include some very relevant usage examples. In the past, I've saved immense amounts of time by understanding those ideas before forging ahead to look for the few functions that I needed. Ever, in a tired fit, look up a function, try it, have it behave unexpectedly, change the inputs, repeat a few times, and finally, exasperated, throw your hands up in resignation? I've done that and half the time, there's something at the top of the docs that could have saved me an hour. It was probably time to leave work anyway. Or cook dinner. Or go to bed. In any case, a surprising amount of software documentation is quite well-written, but we just have to have the patience to scroll up and read a few paragraphs. <small class="parenthetical" >(An unsurprising amount of documentation is written quite poorly.)</small>
    <p>A little goes a long way</p>
    <h2>There Is No Magic</h2>
    <p>There is no magic. Most things are the way they are for a reason. In software, you can basically learn about any system and at any depth if you want.</p>
    <p>Just because there's no magic doesn't mean that it can't seem magical.</p>
    <h2>You Have Time to Learn</h2>
    <p>It's part of the job. Build it into your estimates and take the time to learn. Like in point 4, you can</p>
