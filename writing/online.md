Hello, world!

I'm trying something new: writing online.

I already have a Twitter account. I tweet every so often, but I'd say I'm pretty
bad at tweeting and 280 characters only goes so far.

So consider this the kick-off to Stuff That's Too Long to Tweet&trade;. I hope
some people find it helpful or at least entertaining. Even if they don't, I'm
going to have fun with it.

This first post is the kick-off and it's also documentation for myself on how
I'm going to add &amp; edit content and why. Like why post on this minimal
personal website.

It's so easy to write online these days. There's Medium, [Reading
Supply](https://reading.supply), WordPress, and a gazillion static site
generators. But, I'm going to do it here. It's the fastest way for me to get
started: copy <code>template.html</code>, replace some placeholders, write some
<code>&lt;p&gt;</code>s and <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>s and stuff, and <code>git
push</code>. It's fast to start, fast to write, and fast to load. There's no
transcompiling, no fighting WYSIWYG editors, no complexity. And hey, I can
always switch it up later because it's tried-and-true, basic, semantic HTML and
CSS <small class="parenthetical">(go ahead, look at the source)</small>. Getting
started and actually writing are the hard parts.

This website has been around for about ten years, though it hasn't always been
under version control or had this domain name. I started it when I realized the
University of Waterloo computer science department hosts students' websites for
free <small class="parenthetical">(or tuition, I guess)</small>. I'd figured I'd
put some fun stuff here to show others, but in the end, it became a repository
for my r&eacute;sum&eacute; and an index for some other accounts that I have on
the web. Now it can be more.

I think the beauty of posting stuff here instead of, say, Medium, is that it's
unequivocally mine. I choose what goes in it. I design it however I want. I can
host it wherever I want <small
class="parenthetical">([GitHub](https://github.com/aduong/aduong.github.io) and
[Render](https://render.com))</small>. I can build it however I want and I can
customize it however I want. There are no terms of service and I don't collect
my readers' personal information. There are no paywalls, no cookies, no GDPR or
CCPA cookie popups, and I don't run ads. And I'd like to keep it that way.

To end, I'd like to acknowledge my friend, [Phil Liao](https://pliao39.com), who
has been encouraging me to write online for a while. He started [Summer of
Shipping](https://summerofshipping.com), an online community that connects tech
mentors with college students whose 2020 internships were impacted by COVID-19.
I'd also like to point out some other personal websites whose content or
aesthetic have inspired me:
