      <h1>Writing: Online</h1>
      <time>2020-08-08</time>
      <p>Hello, world!</p>
      <p>I'm trying something new: writing online.</p>
      <p>I already have a Twitter account. I tweet every so often, but I'd say I'm pretty bad at tweeting and 280 characters only goes so far.
      <p>So consider this the kick-off to Stuff That's Too Long to Tweet&trade;. I hope some people find it helpful or at least entertaining. Even if they don't, I'm going to have fun with it.</p>
      <p>This first post is the kick-off and it's also documentation for myself on how I'm going to add &amp; edit content and why. Like why post on this minimal personal website.</p>
      <p>It's so easy to write online these days. There's Medium, <a href="https://reading.supply">Reading Supply</a>, WordPress, and a gazillion static site generators. But, I'm going to do it here. It's the fastest way for me to get started: copy <code>template.html</code>, replace some placeholders, write some <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>s and <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>s and stuff, and <code>git push</code>. It's fast to start, fast to write, and fast to load. There's no transcompiling, no fighting WYSIWYG editors, no complexity. And hey, I can always switch it up later because it's tried-and-true, basic, semantic HTML and CSS <small class="parenthetical">(go ahead, look at the source)</small>. Getting started and actually writing are the hard parts.</p>
      <p>This website has been around for about ten years, though it hasn't always been under version control or had this domain name. I started it when I realized the University of Waterloo computer science department hosts students' websites for free <small class="parenthetical">(or tuition, I guess)</small>. I'd figured I'd put some fun stuff here to show others, but in the end, it became a repository for my r&eacute;sum&eacute; and an index for some other accounts that I have on the web. Now it can be more.</p>
      <p>I think the beauty of posting stuff here instead of, say, Medium, is that it's unequivocally mine. I choose what goes in it. I design it however I want. I can host it wherever I want <small class="parenthetical">(<a href="https://github.com/aduong/aduong.github.io">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://render.com">Render</a>)</small>. I can build it however I want and I can customize it however I want. There are no terms of service and I don't collect my readers' personal information. There are no paywalls, no cookies, no GDPR or CCPA cookie popups, and I don't run ads. And I'd like to keep it that way.</p>
      <p>To end, I'd like to acknowledge my friend, <a href="https://pliao39.com">Phil Liao</a>, who has been encouraging me to write online for a while. He started <a href="https://summerofshipping.com">Summer of Shipping</a>, an online community that connects tech mentors with college students whose 2020 internships were impacted by COVID-19. I'd also like to point out some other personal websites whose content or aesthetic have inspired me:</p>
